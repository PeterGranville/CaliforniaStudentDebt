## Introduction

This report accompanies The Century Foundation's report "Exact Title TBD: Student Debt and Race in California," which examines how student debt puts outsized financial burdens on Black and Latino families in California, especially for graduate borrowers and parents. 

Though California lawmakers rightly draw on national research on student debt and race, state-specific insights can be gleaned from national data sets. TCF's state-level analyses here can help guide state policy that accounts for the distinct patterns of borrowing in California. 

This report draws from the best sources of Califoria-specific data on student debt to explain in depth what we know (and do not know) about student debt in California. It relies primarily on four sources:

* The Federal Student Aid (FSA) Data Center
* The National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS)
* The Survey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking (SHED)
* The College Scorecard

We also draw from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) and the American Community Survey (ACS) to lesser extents. 

The structure of this data-focused report mirrors that of the policy-focused report: the charts and tables in the policy report draw from our four primary data sources in the same order that they are presented here. The first figures in both reports draw from the FSA Data Center, they are followed by figures that draw from NPSAS, and so on. 

This document is more descriptive than prescriptive. Even data queries did not show striking contrasts between groups are included for full transparency, so long as they are relevant to the examination of student loan debt's burden on California borrowers. 

This report is not a static PDF: you can toggle between different versions of charts and hover over barcharts to reveal the exact statistics. The code used to produce this document and its charts and tables can be found at [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/PeterGranville/CaliforniaStudentDebt). All data sets used in this report are publicly available, courtesy of the U.S. Department of Education, the U.S. Federal Reserve, and the U.S. Census Bureau.

## Federal Student Aid Data Center

#### About the data

The FSA Data Center is a repository of data and statistics on federal student aid, including spreadsheets on student loans reported directly from the National Student Loan Data System. For this analysis we use two files from the FSA Data Center: 

* Quarterly reports on the federal student loan portfolio by borrower location, [available here](https://studentaid.gov/data-center/student/portfolio). 
* Quarterly reports on Direct Loan disbursements and borrowers by program at the level of the institution, [available here](https://studentaid.gov/data-center/student/title-iv). 

For "per capita" measures of student debt and borrowing in Table 1, the population for comparison is the estimated total of all California adults aged 18 to 50. I estimate these population totals using American Community Survey data reflecting calendar year 2021, [available here](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/microdata/access.html).

Table 1 below shows how California compares to other states in its federal student loan debt per capita, its number of borrowers per capita, and its average federal student loan balance. California ranks well in the firs two measures due to a smaller percentage of its population holding debt than in other states. However, California's borrowers exceed other states' borrowers in their average balance. Californians who hold federal student loan debt averaged roughly $37,000 in June 2022.

These may come as no surprise given that California has the nation's largest populace, but it also means that California's lawmakers can do more to change the course of the nation's student debt crisis than any other state's leaders.

Comparing California to the rest of the U.S., we find that: 

* California's federal student loan dollars are less concentrated in the Subsidized loan program and the Unsubsidized undergraduate loan program. 
* California's federal student loan dollars are slightly more concentrated in the Unsubsidized graduate loan program and slightly less concentrated in the Parent PLUS loan program. 
* California's federal student loan dollars are much more concentrated in the Grad PLUS loan program, at 19.4% versus 11.0% across the rest of the country.

A major public policy emphasis for state lawmakers, in California as anywhere, is the affordability of undergraduate programs. One sign of California's success in that respect is the lower degree of undergraduate borrowing compared to across the rest of the country. (Of course, even small loan balances can strain a borrower's financial life.)

By contrast, the average Grad PLUS and Parent PLUS loans in California are higher than in the rest of the U.S., as shown in Figure 1 below.

Across all three institutional control categories, California exceeds the rest of the U.S. in the average Parent PLUS loan and the average Grad PLUS loan. Unlike Stafford loans, Parent PLUS and Grad PLUS are both uncapped, meaning a borrower can take out as much as they would like any year. At California nonprofit and for-profit four-years, the average Parent PLUS loan *per year* is north of \$20,000, and the average Grad PLUS loan per year is around \$30,000. In both cases, the averages are lower at public institutions. 

Not every graduate student borrows Grad PLUS, and not every parent who sends their child to college borrows Parent PLUS. However, high averages mean that the lasting burden between those who do borrow and those who do not is greater. These programs are two driving reasons why California has a higher average student loan balance than most other states (per Table 1).

## National Postsecondary Student Aid Study

#### About the data

The statistics in the previous section are all based on state-level and institution-level data. For the most robust information on the relationship between student loan borrowing and race in California, we need student-level data. In the absence of a [national student-level data set](https://www.thirdway.org/video/the-college-transparency-act-explained), we use survey data from the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS).

NPSAS is the largest survey of U.S. college students that has a primary focus on financial aid and college costs. The study has generally been conducted every four years, with the latest published data set reflecting the 2015-16 year (NPSAS:16). With every NPSAS release, separate data sets examine undergraduate and graduate students. 

NPSAS data sets have not traditionally been used for state-level analyses, although the sample size for California students can be large enough to produce reliable estimates depending on the query. This past year, a new edition of NPSAS that was designed for state-representative samples was released. Known as NPSAS:18-AC (Administrative Collection), it draws from student records housed by colleges and the U.S. Department of Education for a sample of 325,000 undergraduates enrolled in 2017-18. Representative samples for public 4-year systems are available in NPSAS-AC for 45 states, and representative samples for public 2-year systems are available for 36 states. Thirty states have representative samples for undergraduate students overall. More information on NPSAS-AC can be found [here](https://nces.ed.gov/pubs2022/2022477.pdf). 

In this section we rely primarily on NPSAS-AC. For analysis of graduate students, we use NPSAS:16 and filter for in-state students in California. The in-state condition is required to run this query in NPSAS:16.

These data are accessed using the National Center on Education Statistics' (NCES) [Datalab tool](https://nces.ed.gov/datalab/). Every query has a unique table retrieval number that can be used by any user to run the query in Datalab. These table retrieval numbers are included in the "Data source and notes" tabs of every chart. 

#### Findings

This research is primarily interested in examining how factors like the racial wealth gap shape the lasting burdens of student debt among California borrowers. Figure 2 below compares average undergraduate borrowing by racial group at California public four-years, compared to U.S. public four-years. 

Across all groups, the average federal loan total is lower in California than nationwide. However, California resembles the U.S. in that Black undergraduates and their families borrow more than their peers. California differs from the U.S. in that Latino/a undergraduates in the state borrow more than white undergraduates, though this is only the case for direct loans to the students and not Parent PLUS.

NPSAS:18-AC does not have state-representative samples for graduate students, so we now use NPSAS:16 to compare the average federal loans for graduate students. California's Black graduate students and those of two or more races borrow significantly more than those who identify with other groups, borrowing between \$20,000 and \$25,000 per year.

It is striking how Black graduate students in California borrow an average that is roughly two-thirds higher than both the average for Black graduate students nationwide and the average for white graduate students in California.

Among California students, the sample is not sufficient for a breakdown by award level. For context, Figure 4 below shows a breakdown of gaps in average loans across all graduate program levels, reflecting the national sample in NPSAS-16. 

In master's programs, research doctorate programs, and professional doctorate programs (e.g. MDs and JDs), Black and Latino/a borrowers borrower more in average federal student loans per year than students from other groups. This demonstrates how professional doctorates show an extreme version of the trends just described.

NPSAS allows us to disaggregate by ethnicity, to a limited extent, for two racial groups (Hispanic and Asian). In California, average federal loans among Filipino undergraduates are higher than other Asian groups, matching a trend seen nationwide.
